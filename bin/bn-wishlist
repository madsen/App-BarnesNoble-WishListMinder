=over

=item C<--configure>

editor if possible.  If the config file does not exist, a skeleton one
will be created.

Send a Price Drop Alert email if any books have been reduced in price
since the last update.  Implies C<--update>.

=item C<--help>

=item C<--quiet> (abbreviated C<-q>)

Normally, when current prices are downloaded from Barnes & Noble,
C<bn-wishlist> prints a list of all changes since the last update.
This option suppresses that output (useful for cron jobs).

This prints a list of all books whose price changed on or after
C<DATE> (in C<YYYY-MM-DD> format).

=item C<--update> (abbreviated C<-u>)

Connect to the Barnes & Noble website, download all configured
wishlists, and record current prices.  Unless this option (or an
option that implies it) is used, C<bn-wishlist> will not make any web
requests.

Display the version of L<App::BarnesNoble::WishListMinder>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Barnes & Noble allows you to create wishlists on their website, but
they don't notify you when an item on your wishlist is on sale or
otherwise reduced in price.  C<bn-wishlist> can be added to your F<crontab>
to monitor your wishlists and email you Price Drop Alerts.

You can also list books by title or author, and display the price
history of any book on your wishlist.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

The F<config.ini> file is stored in {{$dist}}'s data
directory as defined by L<File::HomeDir>.  Run S<C<bn-wishlist --configure>>
to see the actual location on your system.
